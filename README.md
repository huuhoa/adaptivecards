# AdaptiveCards

*Author adaptive cards in pure python*


## Introduction 

[Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) are a great way to extend your bot interactions. However, writing the JSON required to specify the card layout by hand can be cumbersome and error prone. And while using a [designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) is a good way to manually create cards this does not cover cards that are generated by code. AdaptiveCards allows you to author cards in native python without ever touching the underlying json.
